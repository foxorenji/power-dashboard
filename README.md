# Power Dashboard

## Introduction

**Power Dashboard** is a software project designed to showcase abilities that have to do with data visualisation. It is built using Angular and Tailwind.js, whereas NGRX was chosen for state management.


## Features

- **Universal Search**: The user is able to search any cryptocurrency based on any property.
- **Bar Chart**: The user is able to view each cryptocurrency's market cap using ECharts. Hovering shows a tooltip with all the information for that cryptocurrency.
- **Custom Grid**: The user is able to view all cryptocurrencies' information while also being able to sort per column. Data is paginated and is shown 250 at a time.

## Instructions
Please clone the project and install all dependencies before running the application.


## Misc.
Some animations have also been developed and can be found while using the application. Some on them are the sliding theme button and the pulsing effect when data is taking long to load.
Visual elements are from FontAwesome.
